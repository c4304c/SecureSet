# SecureSet
Project that I worked on at my time at SecureSet/Flatiron academy.

For years, I have worked in a field I did not like but was good at.  It took me a while to get out of that field.  I want to learn to protect the world in the "Internet Age."  So, I had decided to enroll in SecureSet Academy.  I hope to be able to help put a stop to cyber-crime. 

I hope you enjoy my code as I continue to learn and grow.  Any adive is appreciated.
