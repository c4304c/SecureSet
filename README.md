# SecureSet
Project that I worked on at my time at SecureSet/Flatiron academy.

For years I worked in a field I did not like but was good at.  It took me a while to get out of that field.  I want to learn to protect the world in the "Internet Age."  So I had decided to enroll in SecureSet Academy.  I hope to be able to help put a stop to cyber-crime.
